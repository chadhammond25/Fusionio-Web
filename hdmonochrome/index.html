                <div class="contentText">
                    <p>With the PXE-Boot server, you can install a new OS over the network. To do so,
                    either select "Boot from Network" (or similar) at your servers boot menu. If you
                    want, you can just change the boot order in the boot menu of your server so that
                    network boot is set to the first option, then you won't have to do this again
                    next time.</p><br />
                    
                    <p>Once the network agent has booted, A PXE-Boot menu will be displayed listing
                    all the available OS installations.</p><br />
                    
                    <p>*Note that the first option is "Boot from local drive" select this if you
                    reached the PXE-Boot menu by accident, or if you changed your mind, and the
                    system will boot normally. If no selection is made after 30 seconds, the system
                    will boot from local drive automatically.</p><br />
                    
                    <p>Once you make your selection, the system will begin installing the OS of your
                    choice. You don't need to do anything else, a kickstart file will guide the
                    installation to completion.</p><br />
                    
                    <p>Grab a cup of coffee, come back in 7-15 minutes (depending on your selection
                    and the quantity of associated packages) and when you get back, the system will
                    have installed the OS, rebooted itself, installed / attached ioDrives, and set
                    the typical (fusion-io) root user/password credentials.</p><br />
                    
                    <h3>** Note: You will notice the system seems to "hang" on the CentOS progress
                        bar during the first boot. This is normal, and part of the ioDrive install (the
                        script is running in the background). Give it a few minutes, (when testing, this
                        took about 5 1/2 minutes to complete) then the login screen will appear as usual.
                        This only happens on the first boot after installing the OS.</h3><br />

                    everything else to work properly.</p><br />
                    
                    <p>There is a public folder at <strong>10.40.2.15:/mnt/fioa/fusion/nfs/public</strong> that anyone can use for
                    easy file transfer or if you want to access something across multiple
                    servers.</p><br />
                    
                    <h3>LabInfoSetup.jar -</h3>
                    
                    <p>This program adds the LabInfoLog.jar file to crontab and sets it to run
                    periodically in the background.</p><br />
                    
                    <h3>LabInfoLog.jar -</h3>

                    data from your server such as server make/model, installed IoDrives, IP address,
                    and OS. You can view all of this info for all servers running the program at

                    you always get the correct kernel version. Also updates firmware to the latest

                    <h3>LocalYum.jar -</h3>
                    
                    <p>One problem I kept running into with auto installing features during the
                    PXE-boot process was authenticating credentials to get past the firewall in order
                    to allow YUM installs. In order to get around this, and avoid prompting the user
                    (or hard coding) a user ID and password, I created a local YUM repository on the
                    PXE-boot server. I also included the EPEL and REMI repositories.</p><br />
                    
                    <p>This program sets up the local repository for use. It places all neccesary
                    keys and repo files in their associated directories. Since the repository is
                    local, and stored on an ioDrive, the downloads are faster than most available
                    mirrors as well.</p><br />

                    some feedback on the installation types that most often (or never) used - i.e.
                    web server, minimal desktop, virtual host, etc, so I can clean up the menu and
                    list only what will get used.</p><br />
                    
                    <h3>More Performance Testing Software -</h3>

                <div class="contentText">
                    <p>I plan to put several other performance testing suites online, similar to
                    Ganglia, so we can compare results from differnet sources and see which one(s)
                    give the best visualization/overall data. When I do, i'll make an install script
                    for them too so it will be simple to spread out for testing on multiple servers
                    with ioDrives.</p>
